Projects go over widely used AI Tools and Concepts

P1 Search Algorithms:
	Pacman finds paths through given maze world, both to reach a specific location
	and to collect food efficiently.
	- Depth-first search
	- Breadth-first search
	- Uniform-cost search
	- A* search
	- Heuristic design

P2 Multi-Agent Pacman:
	Implemented both minimax and expectimax search as well as design an evaluation function.
	- Minimax
	- Expectimax 
	- Alpha-beta pruning

P3 Reinforcement Learning:
	Implemented value iteration and q-learning.
	- Q-learning

Tournament Pacman Capture the Flag:
	Create a Pacman agent that plays capture the flag.
	- Q-learning based implementation
